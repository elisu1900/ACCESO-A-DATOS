# ACCESO-A-DATOS 📁

This repository contains exercises and tasks focused on **data access** in Java — mostly dealing with file operations, serialization, and managing persistent data.  
It’s part of a course on *Acceso a Datos*, exploring how programs read, write, and manipulate files and data formats.

## 📂 Repo Structure & Contents

The repository includes these main components:

- **BibliotecaFicheros/** — a library of file utilities: classes to abstract file I/O, serialization/deserialization, and helper methods.  
- **Ejercicio1/** — the first exercise, likely dealing with basic file reading/writing (text, binary), demonstrating foundational operations.  
- **Tarea_Ampliacion/** — extension tasks that build on the basic exercises with more complexity (e.g. error handling, multiple formats, enhancements).

At present, the repo has **no description, website or topics** in its GitHub metadata. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🎓 Learning Goals

Working through this repository should help you:

- Understand Java I/O mechanisms: streams, readers/writers, buffering  
- Implement serialization / deserialization of objects (binary / text)  
- Handle errors, edge cases, resource closing, and file integrity  
- Expand simple tasks into more robust, extensible solutions  
- Gain practice in designing file-based data access abstractions
