structure:
  - BibliotecaFicheros: "Utility library for file handling operations"
  - Ejercicio1: "Introductory exercise on data access fundamentals"
  - Tarea_Ampliacion: "Extended exercise with advanced features and improvements"

objectives:
  - "Practice techniques for accessing and manipulating persistent data"
  - "Understand separation between business logic and data layer"
  - "Compare file-based and database-based persistence strategies"
  - "Document design and implementation decisions clearly"

technologies:
  - "Java (primary language)"
  - "File I/O APIs (BufferedReader, FileWriter, etc.)"
  - "Serialization mechanisms"
  - "Database access (JDBC or ORM, if applicable)"

usage:
  steps:
    - "Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/elisu1900/ACCESO-A-DATOS.git"
    - "Navigate to the desired folder (Ejercicio1 or Tarea_Ampliacion)"
    - "Set up required dependencies or database (if applicable)"
    - "Run the program or tests as indicated in each subfolder"

best_practices:
  - "Keep data layer and business logic separated"
  - "Implement proper exception handling for I/O operations"
  - "Document design choices and trade-offs"
  - "Write tests covering edge cases (missing files, permissions, corrupted data)"
  - "Provide DB scripts and initial data for reproducibility"
